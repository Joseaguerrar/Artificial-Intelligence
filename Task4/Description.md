# Restaurant Expert System – Logic Programming

## Description

This project is a Logic Programming assignment developed in Prolog.
The goal is to build a simple expert system for a restaurant, where waiters can answer questions based on the menu, the ingredients, and the characteristics of customers.

The system allows queries such as:

- Checking if a customer with specific restrictions can eat a dish.

- Verifying if a dish contains a particular ingredient.

- Recommending dishes suitable for a customer or for a given diet type (vegetarian, vegan, allergic, etc.).

- Suggesting dishes that include a desired ingredient.

- Avoiding suggestions of dishes that customers cannot consume.

## Purpose

The main purpose is to practice knowledge representation and reasoning in Prolog, using facts and rules to simulate decision-making in a real-world context (restaurant menu and dietary restrictions).
